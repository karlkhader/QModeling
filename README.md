# QModeling
QModeling is a multiplatform toolbox for SPM to fit reference-region kinetic models (SRTM, SRTM2, Patlak Reference and Logan Reference Plot are currently available in QModeling) to dynamic PET studies.

The toolbox was developed in the bioengineering department of the Molecular Imaging Unit at CIMES (FGUMA) in collaboration with the department of Computer Science and Programming Languages at Malaga University (UMA).

**QModeling was developed by:**
- Francisco Javier López González | fj.lopez@fguma.es
- José Paredes Pacheco | j.paredes@fguma.es
- Karl-Khader Thurnhofer Hemsi | karlkhader@lcc.uma.es

**With contributions of** Núria Roé Vellvé, Carlos Rossi, Manuel Enciso, Daniel Toro-Flores and Antonio L. Gutiérrez Cardo.
