function demoQModeling()
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Function to run a _demo_ of the command line of QModeling.
%
% At _/QModeling/command_line/demo_ there are four neccesary folders to run
% this demo script:
% 
% -/studies: A folder to the PET studies. You could put here all the studies
% you want to fit. As an example, one study called "study_0" has been
% added.
% -/reference_masks: This folder have to contain the reference masks or TACs of the
% studies which are at the studies folder. The name of this files must be
% the same as the correspond studies.
% -/interest_masks: This folder have to contain the interest masks or TACs of the
% studies which are at the studies folder. The name of this files must be
% the same as the correspond studies.
% -/results: A folder where the results will be saved.
%
% Also, a defautl time table, _TimeTable.txt_ has been included at /QModeling/command_line in
% order to use it in the case the studies do not have frame times.
%
% Once you have run this function (typing demoQModeling at your command
% line window) all the steps executed will be displayed to you.

% Some comments at the code have been included to help you to
% understand each step. And to guide you in the case you would like to change some
% parameters, to add new studies,...
