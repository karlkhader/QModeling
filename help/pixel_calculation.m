%% How do I obtain the parametric images?
% Once the preprocessing is finished and is accepted (by clicking the _Ok_ button
% in the preprocessing configuration window), the pixel-wise calculation panel
% will be enabled. Then, click on the _Set Map Parameters_ button to open 
% the parametric images configuration window. You can select the images
